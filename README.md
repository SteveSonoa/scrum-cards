## About This Project

Our Product Owner wanted my team to have the ability to suggest point values for stories without waiting to see what others have already said. Other phone-based apps that accomplished this required permissions I find inappropriate. So instead, I built my own.

Vertex Cards was designed with vertically-oriented phones in mind; it will run on other screens, but the sizing will look unusual. Simply click a number of points, then everyone reveals their choice at the same time. Click again to go back.

You can find the deployed app on [Heroku](https://vertexcards.herokuapp.com/). Please be patient; it can take around 10 seconds to "wake up" if the node has been inactive.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). After downloading, please run "npm install" to grab your dependencies.
